PHP Assignment Operators
The PHP assignment operators are used with numeric values to write a value to a variable.

The basic assignment operator in PHP is "=". It means that the left operand gets set to the value of the assignment expression on the right.

Assignment	Same as 
x = y	x = y	    The left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right	
x += y	x = x + y	Addition	
x -= y	x = x - y	Subtraction	
x *= y	x = x * y	Multiplication	
x /= y	x = x / y	Division	
x %= y	x = x % y	Modulus
